# Binary-Arithmetic-Expression-Trees
Design and implement expression trees, which are special cases of parse trees or grammar trees.

Program does the following:

  a)  Reads arithmetic expressions from a text file.
  
  b)	Takes binary arithmetic expression as input and builds a binary expression tree for that expression.
  
  c)  Implements two stack-type data structures. 
  
  d)	Checks whether there are any syntactic or semantic errors in the expression. If yes, it reports the errors.
  
  e)	If there are no errors in the input expression,  then 
      •	Calculates and displays the value of the input expression.
      •	Prints the infix (in-order traversal), prefix (pre-order traversal) and postfix (post-order traversal) expressions of the input expression.
